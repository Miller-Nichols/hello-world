# hello-world
repository for first assignment.
My name is Miller Nichols. I love music and I really enjoy playing the guitar fast. I love bands like Black Sabbath and Metallica. My passion for music and playing the guitar makes me want to do something music related for my final project this semester. I was thinking that I would do something that allows an input for a certain chord and then it can tell you what notes are in that chord. Anyways, this is my first github assingment and all... Goodbye!!!
